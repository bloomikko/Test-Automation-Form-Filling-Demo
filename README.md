# DemoQA
Testing playground with DemoQA interactive elements.
Currently contains one test suite for a test form at [DemoQA test environment site.](https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form)

The DemoQA training site is splitted into distinct features which contain their own test suites (for example, alerts and forms are in their own folders). Should several feature sets use same keywords, they are compiled to <code>general.resource</code> file, whereas test specific keywords are in their respective test resource file.

Using Robot Framework and Selenium.
